# Sphere

- The commutation relations between $k_3$, $k_+$, and $k_-$ are shown in [Operator.lean](./Sphere/Operator.lean).
- Flatness of the connection is shown in [Flatness.lean](./Sphere/Flatness.lean), and the exterior derivatives of $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\bar{\lambda}$ are computed in [Differential.lean](./Sphere/Differential.lean).
- That $(\rho, \phi, \bar{\phi})$ and $(\alpha, \lambda, \bar{\lambda})$ are dual is shown in [Duality.lean](./Sphere/Duality.lean).
- The Lie derivative relations between $\rho$, $\phi$, and $\bar{\phi}$ are computed in [Lie.lean](./Sphere/Lie.lean).
